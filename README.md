Implementation of priority queue with an underlying binary heap implementation. The objective of this project is to strengthen my knowledge of JSON and automated testing.
This program was used as a practice for my JSON and automatic testing skills. The script calls a C++ program that takes a command line argument input.json, and verify that whether each sample file has a consecutive inversion, where the ith element is larger than the i+1th element.
